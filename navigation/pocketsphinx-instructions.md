## Tips & Tricks
This is still somewhat experimental, and the fidelity of commands-spoken to commands-heard is far from perfect.  That being said, some things to help maximize:
- Ensure the room is as quiet as possible. Even a small amount of noise can screw things up
- Use Alice if possible. As currently configured, Bob requires the top-half to be on, which can be loud
- Stand closer to the door, since most of the noise comes from the big tower
- I had more luck just speaking toward my computer than using earbuds with a built-in mic. Perhaps a better microphone could improve things
